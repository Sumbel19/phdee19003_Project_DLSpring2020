This repository contains code and results for the Course Project by Deep Learning Spring 2020 course offered at Information Technology University, Lahore, Pakistan. This repository is only for learning purposes and is not intended to be used for commercial purposes.

The results presented below indicate a significant MSE value in some of the cases. This can be attributed to insufficient network training, which required many times the available spectral data. The requisite data was to be obtained through full-wave simulations on a commercial simulator, which were extremely time-consuming, and as such could not be carried out given the time constraints in place.
